# A Star Path Finding Algorithm #

The A Star Path Finding is a well known path finding algorithm that helps to compute the path with the lowest cost (the shortest path) in a given map.

#### Background
* This project helps to visualize the well known A Star Path Finding Algorithm using Pygame.

#### Features
* Users are able to select starting point and ending point
* Users are able to add in obstacles in the map
* Users are able to compute the shortest path between the starting point and the ending point

#### Tech Stack
* Python
* Pygame
